* Image Steganography
My primary operating system, Fedora 34, is not supported by the developer, I could not find a release for this software which runs on Linux.
* Steghide
Steghide is a steganography program that is able to hide data in various kinds of image- and audio-files. The color- respectively sample-frequencies are not changed thus making the embedding resistant against first-order statistical tests.

It can compress embedded data, encrypt the embedded data and can perform automatic integrity checking using a checksum. For cover file, we can use JPEG, BMP, WAV and AU file formats for use as cover file, while for secret data any type of file can be used.
** Installation
Installing =steghide= is quite straightforward:

#+begin_src sh
sudo dnf install steghide
#+end_src

** Usage
From the =steghide= manpage,
[[./screenshots/manpage.png]]
The text to be hidden can be passed either through a file or direct from standard input. 

Some options used are:
- =-ef= filename select the file to embed that is the hidden text
- =-cf= filename select the image or audio to act as cover
- =-sf= filename name the new file to be created (by default cover file is updated)
- =-p= passphrase the password to be used as symmetric key cipher.

1. *Embed text* \\
  Embedding text from file =data=
  #+begin_src shell
$ steghide embed --coverfile image.jpg --embedfile data --passphrase password --stegofile stego.jpg
#+end_src

- *Info*
  Checking if data has been embedded to the file
  #+begin_src shell
$ steghide info stego.jpg
#+end_src

- *Extract*
  Extracting information from file, providing a passphrase
  #+begin_src shell
$ steghide extract --stegofile stego.jpg -p password
#+end_src

The data is extracted to =data=
